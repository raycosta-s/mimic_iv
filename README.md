# mimic_iv

This project proposes a method for calculating SAPS3 for the MIMIC IV database and also provides the final version considering the following scope:

•	Adult patients (age ≥18 years old).
•	Patients admitted to ICU.
•	ICU stays for at least 48 hours.
•	Patients diagnosed with sepsis. 
•	qSOFA score ≥ 2 at the first 48 hours of ICU admission.

I'm happy to help. If you have any questions, please leave your message.
